# ZivaAssignment

**ZivaServiceTrackerAssignment** - Service Fabric architecture
**WebService** - Asp .NET Core web app including authentication and comsuming of data from both Fitbit & Strava APIs.

## Installation

For the sake of the assignment I've just got it setup for deployment to the local cluster (I'm guessing this is how Ziva wanted it so we could easily debug/comb the code). You'll need the Service Fabric SDK & VS 2017 installed.

## Built With

* Visual Studio 2017

## Authors

* **Matthew Spencer** - https://github.com/MatthewCsharp
